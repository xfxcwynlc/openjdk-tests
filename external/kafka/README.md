# External Kafka Tests

Apache kafka tests are part of the external third-party application tests that help verify that the Adoptium binaries are good, by running a variety of Java applications inside of Docker containers. AdoptOpenJDK/openjdk-tests/[Issue #172](https://github.com/AdoptOpenJDK/openjdk-tests/issues/172) lists the applications that we have initially targeted to best exercise the AdoptOpenJDK binaries.  For each application, we choose to run a selection of their functional tests.
Kafka test material is pulled from the [Kafka](https://github.com/apache/kafka.git) repository. 

## Running External Kafka tests locally
To run any AQA tests locally, you follow the same pattern:

0. Ensure your test machine is set up with [test prereqs](https://github.com/AdoptOpenJDK/openjdk-tests/blob/master/doc/Prerequisites.md).  For external tests, you do need Docker installed.

1. Download/unpack the SDK that you want to test to your test machine.
1. `export TEST_JDK_HOME=</pathToWhereYouInstalledSDK>`
1. `git clone https://github.com/AdoptOpenJDK/openjdk-tests.git`
1. `cd openjdk-tests`
1. `./get.sh`
1. `cd TKG`
1. export required environment variables, BUILD_LIST and EXTRA_DOCKER_ARGS (example: `export BUILD_LIST=external/kafka` and `export EXTRA_DOCKER_ARGS="-v $TEST_JDK_HOME:/opt/java/openjdk"`
1. `make compile`              (This fetches test material and compiles it, based on build.xml files in the test directories)
1. `make _kafka_test`   (When you defined BUILD_LIST to point to a directory in [openjdk-tests/external](https://github.com/AdoptOpenJDK/openjdk-tests/tree/master/external), then this is a testCaseName from the playlist.xml file within the directory you chose)


When [running these from the command-line](https://github.com/AdoptOpenJDK/openjdk-tests/blob/master/doc/userGuide.md#local-testing-via-make-targets-on-the-commandline), these tests are grouped under a make target called 'external', so 'make external' would run the entire set of tests found in the openjdk-tests/external directory.  This is unadvisable!  Limit what you compile and run, BUILD_LIST=external/`<someSubDirectory>`, and TARGET=`<testCaseNameFromSubdirPlaylist>`  

These tests run regularly and results can be found in [TRSS Third Party Application view](https://trss.adoptopenjdk.net/ThirdPartyAppView).
